# Architecture and documentation

On Tuesday and Wednesday May 2. and 3. we will look at 

* architecture and its documentation (documentation that goes into your product report). 
* design principles and patterns (object oriented design of your code base that must also be discussed in your product report)

For Monday there is an extract from a book about object-oriented software engineering (Lethbridge and Laganiere). That sounds fancy, but basically it is about constructing the the software with a design where we can achieve qualities such as maintainability, reusability, testability and robustness. We try to pick out the parts which are most relevant for your project and exam. Monday will be mostly theory with some code demo examples.

For Tuesday we will revisit Javadoc (to produce documentation of methods, classes, packages and projects) and UML (to visualize your design). Tuesday will be workshop and based on your own projects.
