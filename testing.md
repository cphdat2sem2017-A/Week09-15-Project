# Testing
## Monday April 18

As preparation for Monday, you should view the following on Lynda:
<https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Welcome/124398/137955-4.html>. 
It is nearly two hours, so remember to set some time aside.

There are a few sections which can be skipped:

- There is a section on how to do it in Eclipse - we use Netbeans, so that is different for us.
- Section 5 "Additional topics" can be skipped

### Main leaning objectives are:
* unit testing
* test design
* blackbox test
* whitebox test
* test coverage

Mostly it is not recommended to test the actual database layer. 
However, that is a shame as many get the database layer wrong. Once the structure is in place, it is fairly straight forward to do.

### Main leaning objectives are:
* database integration testing 
* Designing for testability


Reading:

- This [note by Lasse Koskela](databaseTest.md) explains the principle of how to seperate the connection object from the actual database facade.
